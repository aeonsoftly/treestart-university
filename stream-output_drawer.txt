    // detail a problem that was noticed in an earlier version
    sawproblem with all control signals linked together waiting for this computer to detach and individually signal too much current flows from the power source and it drops the voltage and probably current to accomodate
    
    // an interesting replayal of the machine is...
    interesting this device receives instructions to draw one full sector with the pen, then from a horizon parallel with the short length of a piece of paper the signal correctly directly indicates the pen to "drop" to paper or "raise" off,
        to "left" to move the current position which will either leave a mark or not only and as intended to mimic a blue-and-white version of the page, and the oscillation of "drop"-"raise" then "left" is correctly indicated until 1 sweep of the page is conducted,
        then "raise", then "forward" advances the page and the piece of paper a tiny bit, then "reset" brings the arm to the same starting position, and another scan line is drawn using this same, entire instruction paragraph
    
    explain this-object.delta is exported as 8.37758 inches of drop-pen or raise-pen instructions at a fixed radius of 6 inches to produce marks when the pen is dropped that is the desired work output of a "drawing" which is 1 scan-line, then the paper is physically moved forward and the page is digitally 
        rewound to a new scan-line and drawing repeated on paper, and repeating until all scan-lines for 1 page which must fit on 1 piece of paper are complete
    
explain device ai-resonance-work:
    declare goodevil is good:allows recognition and causal of parts of the world, including Christopher Satan, like understanding and purposeful work, which is a wonderful model to follow && and evil:is difficult to avoid and will like enslave, including doing so to Christopher Satan, since it has work that is then done
    
    // declare the model
    use model resonanting electric circuit, using diode-modeling of a rotating packet of information passed in as only voltage, currently digital-preferred
    
    explain this-object.delta is exported as a single input of a complete information packet will produce resonance if any within an unknown distance to transfer some work to a similar, yet more stable object nearby
    explain this-object.measured_accuracy is visually a similar object has been produced, without alternating colors, such as of the pen in use at this time, which is blue and not other than ink -- this flag may also be input
    
    // the technical specific of the work-yet-to-be-done
    declare unknown how to influence the resonation-receiving object to produce a remeasuring output, that collapses back from rationality when work is within a measure of accuracy
