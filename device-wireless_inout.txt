explain deviceliteral wireless_in {
    uses a rational device as input, then output is the obtained physical, irrational object as follows:
        given a physical, irrational object,
        explain it's input as only the physical arrival of packet of information in form of two distinct rational tandems, only 1 specified by this device as "preferred wavelength and style, exclusionary"
        allow variable this.wavelength or similar to select the input wavelength only, and exclude other styles
        allow variable this.frequency or similar to select the speed-of-light, 1/300,000,000 meters/second apply instead of wavelength, measured in meters only, or as specified in denomination, and exclude other styles
        allow variable this.polarity or similar to select this phase-shift of light, and exclude other lights and styles of messaging
        etc is possible but not recognized at this time unless error is detected or future use-case appears
    
    input.in is packet denomination only, limit is as detected by radar
    output.out is packet denomination only, and no formatting done at this time, no specific limit applied except do not allow additional computing on this device, called a "filter"
    
    input.in recv
    output.out is as input.in is, end
}

explain deviceliteral wireless_out {
    uses an irrational object as input, then split is output
    
    input.in is packet denomination only, limit is
    output.out is as intended, usually packet form, no limit specified
    input.in recv
    
    input.in transmits into output.form as follows:
        output.wavelength is characteristic, and flow-energy is limited to match success 50% or greater
        end

    measure math problems and solve, attempting to incorporate the solved information to improve the computer, like by x^2+1=0 method where a functional transformation of input reinforces itself yet is always distant by similar unit to predicted end
    unknown protocol, including wavelength or signal-demeter, to be more useful
