# Treestart University, compiler program
Use the compiler in compiler/main.go to run the code into the format used by any magnet to execute! Here are usage instructions:

    treestart-university % go version
    go version go1.20.5 darwin/amd64
    treestart-university % go run compiler/main.go compiler/testcode.txt
    Successfully compiled compiler/testcode.txt
    
Print the code once it's compiled, and place it close to a magnet to see the code run!

## Theory
Encryption is a system of creating an irrational value. Using a message and a process it produces a single output that contains unique and interesting relationships designed though to conceal the message. Even with the message in hand some other way theuniqueness of the encryption set creates "new knowledge" to study!<br>
<br>
This follows the theory as follows:<br>
a. Produce a set of classes as follows,<br>
b. The later classes must be too difficult to learn without the earlier one.<br>
c. Consume from an unlimited resource such as "the universe in some category, such as sailing, music theory, etc.", Produce! [a,b,c,d,...]<br>
<br>
This is similar to a system of encryption as follows:<br>
a. Using 2, encrypt: 2 * 3 produces 6, as the encrypted message. 3 is a "key" that is some network to produce the encrypted text.<br>
b. Study the encrypted message to determine it's features. This study is the key to using this method of computing.<br>
<br>
All encrypted messages contain both the original message <b>and</b> new information! This is what Treestart University (powered by a powerful magnet) does to work-- <b>balance the magnet into a complex higher-level, by relationships found in this encrypted, or "compiled" code</b>.
